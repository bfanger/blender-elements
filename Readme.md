# Blender Elements

Bringing the UI controls from the [Blender 3D creation suite](https://blender.org) to the web.

Demo: https://bfanger.nl/blender-elements/

## Highlights
- Desktop first
- Build as WebComponents

### Desktop first
Focussing on increasing productivity on desktop and taking advantage of things like: hover-state, click-and-drag, rightclick, keyboard shortcuts, etc.

### Build as WebComponents
Lightweight (zero dependancies), build with native web technologies.
Framework agnostic, works standalone but can be used in Angular, React, Vue and other frameworks that support webcomponents.
